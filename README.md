 Make a bot that clicks the screen as fast as possible in python then swap to C and build it again


Tools I will need

Something to find pixle number on the screen 
Something to find pixle color

while loop


Steps

Write a "while" loop that is always running unless I press "q" to stop it

Check if this pixel is red.
While the pixel is red do nothing.
Once the pixel is green click that pixel
